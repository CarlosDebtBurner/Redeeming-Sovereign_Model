Created by Carlos Javier Perez Loeza

## Mission

To develop a sovereign monetary framework that:

- Ends debt traps and predatory credit cycles  
- Eradicates systemic poverty through universal, behavioral equity  
- Re-centers currency on human dignity, not banking profits

---

## Overview

The Redeeming Sovereign Model reimagines how money, dignity, and digital trust can coexist in sovereign economies. It proposes:

- Universal capital distribution to all adult citizens  
- Behavior-sensitive smart contracts guiding savings, taxation, and credit  
- Progressive, programmable taxation (e.g., 0% on food, 75% on luxury goods)  
- On-chain public credit independent of traditional banks  
- Token-burning debt resolution to mitigate long-term inflation risks  

This framework integrates blockchain infrastructure with monetary policy logic to promote fairness, efficiency, and national self-determination.

# The Redeeming Sovereign Model  
![Patent Pending](https://img.shields.io/badge/Patent-Pending-orange)

A Sovereign Digital Currency for Economic Restoration and Human Dignity  
Created by: Carlos Javier Perez Loeza

### Version 1.0 – Foundational Release

This is the initial public release of the Redeeming Sovereign Model (RSM), a programmable digital currency framework designed to enhance equity, opportunity, and national resilience through innovative monetary design. Academic refinement will follow as part of upcoming graduate studies at Cambridge and SOAS.

## Mission

To develop a sovereign monetary framework that:

- Enhances access to opportunity and economic inclusion  
- Encourages long-term financial responsibility through smart design  
- Aligns currency use with shared human values and social well-being  

---

## Overview

The Redeeming Sovereign Model introduces a new economic architecture grounded in transparency, dignity, and self-determination. It proposes:

- Universal capital distribution to all adult citizens  
- Smart contracts that guide savings, taxation, and responsible credit  
- Behavioral incentives tied to public-good outcomes  
- Progressive, programmable taxation (e.g., 0% on food, 75% on luxury goods)  
- Deflationary supply logic via token-burning upon loan repayment  

This model integrates blockchain infrastructure with real-world policy logic to support a sustainable and adaptive monetary system.

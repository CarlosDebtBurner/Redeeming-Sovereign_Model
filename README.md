# The Redeeming Sovereign Model

A Sovereign Digital Currency for Economic Restoration and Human Dignity  
Created by Carlos J. Perez

## Mission

To develop a sovereign monetary framework that:

- Ends debt traps  
- Eradicates systemic poverty  
- Re-centers currency on human dignity, not banking profits

## Overview

The Redeeming Sovereign Model reimagines how money, dignity, and digital trust can coexist. It offers:

- Universal capital distribution to all adult citizens  
- Automated savings and responsible spending tools  
- Programmable taxation (e.g., 0% on food, 75% on luxury)  
- Behavior-based public credit (outside traditional banks)  
- Mechanisms to burn repaid debt, fighting inflation and accumulation

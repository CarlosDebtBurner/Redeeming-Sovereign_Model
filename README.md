The Redeeming Sovereign Model

A Sovereign Digital Currency for Economic Restoration and Human DignityCreated by Carlos J. Perez

Mission

To develop a sovereign monetary framework that:

Ends debt traps and predatory credit cycles

Eradicates systemic poverty through universal, behavioral equity

Re-centers currency on human dignity, not banking profits

Overview

The Redeeming Sovereign Model reimagines how money, dignity, and digital trust can coexist in sovereign economies. It proposes:

Universal capital distribution to all adult citizens

Behavior-sensitive smart contracts guiding savings, taxation, and credit

Progressive, programmable taxation (e.g., 0% on food, 75% on luxury goods)

On-chain public credit independent of traditional banks

Token-burning debt resolution to mitigate long-term inflation risks

This framework integrates blockchain infrastructure with monetary policy logic to promote fairness, efficiency, and national self-determination.

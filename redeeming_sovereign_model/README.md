# The Redeeming Sovereign Model

This repository contains the initial conceptual simulation for the Redeeming Sovereign Model, an economic policy innovation authored by Carlos J. Perez.

## Purpose
To simulate the potential for reducing global inequality and poverty by implementing a sovereign currency system with a demurrage feature, redistributing idle capital to productive uses.
